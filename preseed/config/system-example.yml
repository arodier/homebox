# Example file to create an ISO image installer with Debian preseed.

# 1. Setup SSH authentication:
# Copy your public key in "preseed/misc/root/.ssh/authorized_key".
# This key will be copied into the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys for you to connect to your linux server

# 2. Customisation:
# Copy this file to common.yml, and modify the values accordingly
# You can use a dedicated Linux machine as an ISO image builder, or use your workstation.
# Associated with libvirt, and snapshots, it can be used as a development environment for the mail server.

# 3. Build the ISO image
# Example of a command to run to build the ISO image
# ansible-playbook -v -i ../config/hosts.yml playbooks/build-cd.yml
# This will create the ISO images in /tmp folder. Use the DVD one for automatic installation.

# 4. Use a physical server or a VM to run the Debian installer.
# The whole installation should be automatic, with LVM and software RAID
# For LVM, there is a volume called "reserved" you can remove. This will let
# you resize the other volumes according to your needs.

# 5. See the documentation and the Ansible scripts into the install folder to install the mail server platform.

# System configuration sample 1: Encrypted hard drive
# system:
#   hostname: mail
#   preseed: luks
#   version: 9.6
#   arch: amd64
#   boot_timeout: 5   # In seconds
#   passphrase: I will not give you my password
#   hw:
#     disks:
#       - name: vda
#         size: 500G

# System configuration sample 2: Software RAID
# WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT FULLY TESTED YET
# TODO: Add encryption support (ecryptfs?)

# The proxy is optional. When specified, it is used to configure apt
network:
  # proxy:               # something like http://proxy.example.com:3128/
  domain: example.com
  iface: auto            # or use eth0, ens3, etc...
