SSH keys and configuration files for the user {{ user.uid }}

This email contains the configuration for your all your SSH keys

1. Copy all the files in your ~/.ssh folder

  The files can be copied as is, they are public keys or configuration files,
  and donâ€™t need to be saved with restricted permissions.
  For instance:

  chmod 0644 ~/.ssh/*.pub  ~/.ssh/*.conf


2. Save your private files using the file file name, in your ~/.ssh folder

  For each public key file, use the same file name, without the ".pub" extension.

  chmod 0600 ~/*.ssh/*.rsa ~/*.ssh/*.ecdsa


3. Finally, add the following line in your ~/.ssh/config file:

  Include ~/.ssh/git-*-ssh.conf


4. You can now use the server for your personal git repositories, for instance:

  git remote add personal git.{{ network.domain }}
  git push --all personal
  git push --tags personal
