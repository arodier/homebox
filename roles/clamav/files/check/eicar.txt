The EICAR Anti-Virus Test File or EICAR test file is a computer
file that was developed by the European Institute for Computer
Antivirus Research (EICAR) and Computer Antivirus Research
Organization (CARO), to test the response of computer antivirus (AV)
programs. Instead of using real malware, which could cause real
damage, this test file allows people to test anti-virus software
without having to use a real computer virus.
