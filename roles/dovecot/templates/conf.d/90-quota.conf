## Quota configuration.

# Note that you also have to enable quota plugin in mail_plugins setting.
# <doc/wiki/Quota.txt>

##
## Quota limits
##

# Quota limits are set using "quota_rule" parameters. To get per-user quota
# limits, you can set/override them by returning "quota_rule" extra field
# from userdb. It's also possible to give mailbox-specific limits, for example
# to give additional 100 MB when saving to Trash:

plugin {
  #quota_rule = *:storage=1G
  #quota_rule2 = Trash:storage=+100M

  # LDA/LMTP allows saving the last mail to bring user from under quota to
  # over quota, if the quota doesn't grow too high. Default is to allow as
  # long as quota will stay under 10% above the limit. Also allowed e.g. 10M.
  #quota_grace = 10%%
}

##
## Quota warnings
##

# You can execute a given command when user exceeds a specified quota limit.
# Each quota root has separate limits. Only the command for the first
# exceeded limit is excecuted, so put the highest limit first.
# The commands are executed via script service by connecting to the named
# UNIX socket (quota-warning below).
# Note that % needs to be escaped as %%, otherwise "% " expands to empty.

plugin {
  #quota_warning = storage=95%% quota-warning 95 %u
  #quota_warning2 = storage=80%% quota-warning 80 %u
}

# Example quota-warning service. The unix listener's permissions should be
# set in a way that mail processes can connect to it. Below example assumes
# that mail processes run as vmail user. If you use mode=0666, all system users
# can generate quota warnings to anyone.
service quota-warning {
  executable = quota-status -p postfix
  inet_listener {
    port = {{ mail.quota.port }}
  }
}

## Quota backends

plugin {
  quota = maildir:user-quota:ns=
  quota2 = maildir:archive-quota:ns=Archives/

  quota_rule = *:storage={{ mail.quota.default }}
  quota2_rule = *:storage={{ mail.quota.archive }}
}
