# Presentation

SOGo is a fully supported and trusted groupware server with a focus on scalability and open standards.

SOGo provides a rich AJAX-based Web interface and supports multiple native clients through the use of standard protocols
such as CalDAV, CardDAV and GroupDAV, as well as Microsoft ActiveSync.

SOGo offers multiple ways to access calendaring and messaging data. Your users can either use a web browser, Microsoft
Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple iCal, or a mobile device to access the same information.
